            Weightlifting has several health benefits, including both physical and mental health. Which means if you start weightlifting you can feel better physically and mentally!<br><br>A study done by Duke University found that 60% of peoplpe suffering from depression could overcome their depression by doing short weighttraining sessions only four days a week, rather then taking antidepressants. This isn't seen with all exercise, so running may not have the same effect.<br><br> Several studies have shown physcical health benefits such as decreasing blood pressure, lower bad cholesterol, and and improved blood circulation through strengthining the heart and blood vessles. <br><br> There are plenty more health benefits, but the complete list is far too long to include in  highschool intro class project.
