            The biggest reason a lot of people get into weightlifting is to look cooler. Althought I think being healthy is a better reason, others will argue it's all about looks. If you want chiseled abs and big biceps, weightlifting will be your best friend.<br><br>
            Simply when you weightlift, your muscles break down, and while you recover, your muscle mass will increase.<br><br>
            The man to the left is a popular weightlifting influencer online named Noel Deyzel. As you can see he has dedicated a lot of time in the gym, however a cool thing about weightlifting is how you look depends on how you train, so if you want to look different than him, you can train different than him. <br><br> <img                            src="https://i0.wp.com/musculardevelopment.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/big-ramy.jpg?w=668&ssl=1" alt="bigramy"> This guy is Big Ramy,the most recent Mr Olympia winner. Mr Olympia is the biggest body building competition in the world. He looks the way he does through training hard in the gym.
